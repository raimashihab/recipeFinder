# recipeFinder
The Recipe Finder Application is a Python-based program designed to help users find 
recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. The application utilizes the 
Spoonacular API to search for recipes and retrieve relevant information such as 
cooking time, servings, rating, instructions, and ingredients. Users can also specify 
dietary restrictions and maximum cooking time to refine their search results. The 
application utilizes the tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to 
enhance user interaction.
